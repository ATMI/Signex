## Introduction

Signature recognition is a valuable tool in various domains, including banking, legal, and security applications. This architecture provides a framework for building a signature recognition system using machine learning algorithms.

The architecture consists of several components, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and signature verification. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can set up and deploy your own signature recognition system.

## Architecture

The signature recognition architecture follows a pipeline-based approach, involving the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: This step involves preparing the signature data for further analysis. It may include tasks such as image resizing, noise removal, and normalization.

2. Feature Extraction: In this step, relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed signature images. Common techniques include extracting statistical features, texture-based features, or using deep learning-based approaches.

3. Model Training: The extracted features are used to train a machine learning model, which learns the patterns and characteristics of genuine signatures. This step involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model on labeled data, and optimizing its parameters.

4. Signature Verification: Once the model is trained, it can be used to verify the authenticity of new signature samples. The system compares the extracted features of the input signature with those learned during training to make a prediction.

## Requirements

To run the signature recognition architecture, the following requirements should be fulfilled:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file
- Sufficient computing resources (CPU/GPU) for training and inference

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.pg.innopolis.university/sofwarus-progectus/signature-recognition.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```shell
cd signature-recognition
```

3. Install the necessary Python packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the signature recognition architecture, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare your signature dataset and ensure it is appropriately labeled.

2. Preprocess the signature images, applying necessary transformations such as resizing, noise removal, or normalization. Implement this step according to your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.

3. Extract relevant features from the preprocessed images. Choose appropriate feature extraction techniques based on the nature of the dataset and the characteristics you want the model to learn.

4. Train the signature recognition model using the extracted features and the labeled dataset. Select a suitable machine learning algorithm and adjust the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. Once the model is trained, you can perform signature verification on new samples. Provide the input signature image, preprocess it using the same transformations as during training, extract features, and feed them to the trained model for prediction.
